            <p>Joe (ジョー) is the ring name of the main protagonist of the anime, Megalo Box. Previously known as Junk Dog
                (ジャンクドッグ), his real name has yet to be revealed. He used to make a living by throwing matches
                underground with Gansaku Nanbu.</p>
            <p>After meeting the Megalonia champion, Yuri, he did everything to enter the Megalonia and fight the
                champion under Team Nowhere. His ring name became "Gearless Joe" after he fought his first opponent
                without using a gear, and this becoming his signature way of fighting in the ring. Eventually he fights
                against Yuri, managing to get a KO in the thirteenth round.</p>
            <p>Instead of staying as the Megalonia champion, Joe left the ring and stayed together with Sachio in
                Nanbu's vegetable farm behind Gym Nowhere.</p>
